Installation
------------

1. Install RabbitMQ and Management Plugin from:

     http://www.rabbitmq.com 

2. In the RabbitMQ Management Web UI add:

 1. A direct exchange called "postgres"
 
 2. A queue called "transactions"

 3. Bind the queue "transactions" to the exchange "postgres" with the routing key "pubish_transactions"

3. Create two databases:

 1. createdb server
 
 2. createdb client
 
4. Install pg_amqp in to the "server" database. PostgreSQL from:

      https://labs.omniti.com/labs/pgtreats/browser/trunk/contrib/pg_amqp 

      or
   
        easy_install pgxnclient
        pgxnclient install pg_amqp

      then
 
        psql server < pg_amqp.sql

5. Import the schemas

Kick off all three apps in different terminals:

1. Kick off ./consumer.py

Notes
-----

I included a setup.sh file here if install the requirements, it will do all of the postgres specific schema setup and the pg_amqp.sql file included in the distro is copied from my contrib install of pg_amqp and your milage may vary.

I used PostgreSQL 9.0.3, RabbitMQ 2.4.1, pika 0.9.6pre0 (github master), psycopg2 2.4.1 and Python 2.6.1
